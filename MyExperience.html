            <li>I've developed an <span class = "object">Amazon Alexa</span> aplication that can identify near earth objects from <span class = "object">NASA's API</span></li>
            <li>I've made educational videos explaining chemistry through a python program called <span class = "object">Manim.</span></li>
            <li>I've utilized <span class = "object">AutoIT</span> to program automated tasks on my computer.</li>
            <li>I've created a program in <span class = "object">AutoIT</span> that can generate and verify keys with an online server in order to verify the software's license.</li>
            <li>I've made an app that can tell soil moisture anywhere in the globe using <span class = "object">NASA's EOSDIS library.</span></li>
