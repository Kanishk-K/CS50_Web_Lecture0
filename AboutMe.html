            Thank you for visiting my web page to learn more about me, I am currently a high school junior who is very interested in programming.<br>
            I have had many years of experience and personally I would like to finally be able to put all of what I've learned into a more rigid<br>
            and connected format such as a mixture of HTML, CSS, SQL and Python.
