index.html 
===========
index.html is the file that is the homepage of my website, it has links to the other three pages. The @media query in the css applies to this file, by shrinking the viewer the table will decrease in size and the font size for the title will decrease. This also contains the table object.

AboutMe.html
============
A very basic html page consisting of a "p" tag and a link back to index.html

MyExperience.html
=================
This is the html file that is perhaps the most complex out of the previous ones, it has bootstrap rows, columns and buttons in order to add style to the webpage. Furthermore, while the file does not have a @media query associated with it, the webpage uses the bootstrap grid model to make the webpage mobile responsive.
