            On this web page I will talk about my aspirations and hobbies.

            One of my biggest goals is to get accepted to a college that I believe can help me achieve my dreams of being a <br>
            software engineer. Furthermore, I also do plan on creating educational videos through the use of Manim as I believe <br>
            knowledge is best when shared. Lastly, I want to learn how to create dynamic websites as it seems very interesting and practical.
